# AndroidGame_Unity
A ~2016 hobby Android game created with Unity and written in C#.
This is a project that I used to spend time on between courses and during summer, I let it evolve freely over time and got to become quite
comfortable with the engine and learnt a thing or two about game development.<br>
In the root directory you can find a .APK file ready to go if you wish to try it out. Otherwise you can watch a short video demo right here: https://youtu.be/uF9qFo-pm1k
